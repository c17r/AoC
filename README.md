Advent of Code
=

[The Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) plus the Christmas advent calendar means [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)! On midnight from 01-Dec to 25-Dec a new puzzle is released.

Some people are into speed running the competition. You've got to be pretty quick to make it into the top 100, 1-2 minutes per part!

I'm just in it for the fun.
