Advent of Code
=

[The Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) plus the Christmas advent calendar means [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)! On midnight from 01-Dec to 25-Dec a new puzzle is released.

Some people are into speed running the competition. You've got to be pretty quick to make it into the top 100, 1-2 minutes per part!

I'm just in it for the fun.

- **14-Dec-2018 Update:** I've gotten hooked. Even though I'm nowhere near fast enough for the top 100 I'm still up at midnight to be ranked against everyone else with the global clock. I think I have a problem.

I started with 2018. When I've got time I'll work on previous years.
